This is a pale imitation of the series, and a very dated movie. The movie version of Whoops is not like the TV series at all. In fact, it&#39;s really a remake in name only. The plot is completely different, centering around a skirmish in a small island run by the UK, and as a result, a royal princess is kidnapped and held for ransom until the island is returned to its people. This leads to a nuclear standoff with the Russians/Soviets. This was shot in the 1980&#39;s, so the plot mirrors the Falkland Islands situation at the time. While the original miniseries was also about the Cold War, it&#39;s much funnier and more timeless than this film. The film feels very compressed, rushing over things and trying to cram everything into a 90 minute running time. There are logic holes as well, especially dealing with the terrorist Lacrobat, played by Michael Richards. Lacrobat seems to be a magic man that has ready made disguises for every occasion and can outwit entire armies and nations in just a few minutes. Another issue is the rather silly ending. It feels lazy and even manipulative. There&#39;s also a really bad scene with a &quot;rambogram&quot; that feels like an outtake from The Naked Gun (which came out a year before this film).Despite this, there are several great performances by Loretta Swit, Peter Cook, Ian Richardson, and as mentioned above, a funny turn by Michael &quot;Kramer&quot; Richards from Seinfeld. There are a few hilarious moments, mostly at the beginning of the film, but overall, it&#39;s a disappointing film.

I think almost every film buff does. If you don&#39;t know, the movies are typically cheesy, low budget b-movies from the 1950s-1970s. They&#39;re not good movies (though a few make the exception), they&#39;re just laughably bad. This is what I thought would be the case with Sidehackers otherwise known as Five the Hard Way. I didn&#39;t expect it to be that good. But what I saw was probably one of the worst movies I&#39;ve ever seen. I&#39;m not even kidding. It was horrible. Not even the riffs could save it, and I&#39;ve never seen a movie like that before. Even with something wretched like Manos: The Hands of Fate, Joel and the bots could still make it funny. With this, that almost doesn&#39;t happen. I&#39;m not even saying that the riffs are bad. The biggest problem is that the movie takes itself way to seriously. Coleman Francis movies also took themselves too seriously, but whereas those movies would annoy you with their pretentiousness at the 10 minute mark, this film does it immediately. I don&#39;t know how to describe it. It tries to shove senseless violence into the plot without anything that even makes a good movie. So the best way to describe this movie is that it feels uncomfortable. Unsurprisingly the violence doesn&#39;t make it enjoyable because it&#39;s not done well and there&#39;s nothing of any substance to even it out. And I watched a censored television version so it was probably worse than that. Overall the movie is just depressing throughout.

about Blow Job (2002), to remove them immediately, as they are in no way related to my film and give completely the wrong impression about the film and the people involved in it.Blow Job (2002) is a 10 minute comedy, albeit based around the issue of oral sex, it&#39;s mainly conversational, was a lot of fun to make and there are certainly no explicit sex scenes.I don&#39;t know whether these comments are in all honesty mistaken for another film, or from people who find it amusing to write misleading comments about films.Whatever the reason, the efforts of the actors in particular but also the crew and sponsors of the film do not deserve to have their names cheapened by such crass comments. I&#39;m being far more reserved in my comments than I feel, as I was initially taken aback and then bloody furious that idiots can get away with writing such tripe about a film they&#39;ve obviously never seen!I sincerely hope the comment writers have the good grace to remove these comments asap.Debs Taz Writer/Director of Blow Job (2002) Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: A Chip of Glass Ruby Genres: [\"Drama\"] Release Date: 11/30/1981 (South Africa) IMDb Rating: 6.4/10 from 12.0 users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: The Big Sweep Genres: [\"Animation\",\"Short\",\"Adventure\"] Release Date: November 10, 1990 (United States) IMDb Rating: 8.0/10 from 11.0 users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Most Sexy Licking Cock Tease Genres: [\"Adult\"] Release Date: May 1, 2017 (Germany) IMDb Rating: Unknown/10 from Unknown users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Episode #1.101 Genres: [\"Drama\",\"Romance\"] Release Date: 1977 (Venezuela) IMDb Rating: Unknown/10 from Unknown users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Episode dated 14 March 1978 Genres: [\"Comedy\",\"Music\",\"Talk-Show\"] Release Date: March 14, 1978 (United States) IMDb Rating: Unknown/10 from Unknown users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Dead Men Don\\'t Jump Genres: [\"Animation\",\"Comedy\",\"Fantasy\"] Release Date: October 15, 1994 (United States) IMDb Rating: 6.6/10 from 27.0 users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Episode dated 24 February 2004 Genres: [\"Horror\",\"Comedy\"] Release Date: February 24, 2004 (Spain) IMDb Rating: Unknown/10 from Unknown users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Dawn of War Review Genres: [\"Comedy\"] Release Date: April 11, 2013 (Sweden) IMDb Rating: Unknown/10 from Unknown users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Episode #1.5789 Genres: [\"Drama\",\"Romance\"] Release Date: June 28, 2004 (United Kingdom) IMDb Rating: Unknown/10 from Unknown users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Tunes of Glory Genres: [\"Family\"] Release Date: May 20, 1963 (United Kingdom) IMDb Rating: Unknown/10 from Unknown users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: 5.0 User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: 6.

If you like these filmmakers, chances are you will appreciate SRW. If you don&#39;t know these filmmakers, its still definitely worth a look for its layered storytelling, and new take on old school westerns.After viewing the film, I was quite impressed, knowing that this film was shot with a shoe-string budget, didn&#39;t really cross my mind while I was watching it. That in itself is a feat. Also working with relatively unknown actors (aside from Feore, who&#39;s scenes are short but sweet), one might think that without a lightening pace, interest could fade. It doesn&#39;t. In fact it builds throughout the film as each character&#39;s pasts and motives come to light. Some are explained more than others, which leaves some questions to be asked, but in a good way, a la the man with no name. The story is told in a Tarantino-esquire, non linear format that leaves the viewer hanging, and the slow build to the inevitable showdown is done with sharp stylized dialogue, splashes of violence and some beautiful eye candy shots.This film is not for the impatient, but if you stick with it, you will find it rewarding with its post-apocalyptic hinted setting, cryptic storytelling and an outcome that will leave you wanting to know more about the story, after the film ends. A great little indie film. Qudos to the Bros Campagna, looking forward to see what comes next.

It&#39;s merely OK self-reflexive porn.Opening of Shaun himself and buddy Alan Marlow running away has them established as porn actors, which of course they are. They go to a rock band audition to perform in drag, and the film establishes a pleasant enough fast pace with improvised dialogue the rule.Shaun&#39;s frizzy blonde wig as Lola is amusing, and Marlow as Bubbles plays &quot;I&#39;m a Woman&quot; by Maria Muldaur, playing guitar nicely. When their hair explodes, our phonies are unmasked, but band leader Terri Hall humps them anyway, with the patented 2 dicks in her mouth at once trick plus a d.p.Self-referential they admit to having acted in THE LOVE BUS, an earlier real-life Costello movie. Ashley Monroe portrays a police sergeant hot on their tail, claiming they are notorious for their fisting exploits on screen.A lame spoof of Don Kirshner&#39;s rock concert TV series (he&#39;s spoofed as &quot;Don Cockner&quot;) has Terri&#39;s band performing on the boob tube, and the sergeant recognizes our heroes in drag.Costello lifts considerable Chick Corea (and perhaps even some Keith Jarrett style solo piano) for his soundtrack, as background for guest star C.J. Laing to demonstrate her deep throat technique. Finale has the band watching themselves on TV lip-syncing to Janet Joplin. An orgy breaks out with some whipping using a leather belt thrown in and Terri on top in St. George position manages to integrate dance moves with sex.Pretty much a stillborn exploration of the material, this NYC troupe managed to fashion a passable time killer for porn addicts.

Genres: [\"Comedy\",\"Musical\",\"Romance\"] Release Date: 8/8/1952 (Netherlands) IMDb Rating: 5.7/10 from 560.0 users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: 7.0 Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: 24.0 total, Average Rating: 5.0 Featured Review: One of my least favourite films/musicals featuring Esther Williams, along with &#39;Texas Carnival&#39; and &#39;Jupiter&#39;s Darling&#39;. All three watchable but very flawed. &#39;Skirts Ahoy!&#39; is not a sinking dud, but considering the talent involved (as well as Williams, there&#39;s Vivian Blaine, Debbie Reynolds, Bobby Van and songs penned by Harry Warren and Ralph Blane) it should have been better, much better.Williams herself is captivating, she has a graceful charm and sassiness, while her swimming talent and aquatic skills are enough to make one green with envy. She is well supported by a polished and energetic turn from Vivian Blaine, while Billy Eckstine and Emmett Lynn are suitably sincere and Debbie Reynolds and Bobby Van lighten up the screen and really liven things up.&#39;Skirts Ahoy!&#39; looks nice enough, the costume and set design are not elaborate or lavish but handsome and colourful enough and the film is photographed very nicely. The songs are all pleasant, though only one is properly memorable and that is the modest hit &quot;What Good is a Girl (Without a Guy&quot;). The way the numbers are staged is energetic and graceful and enthusiastically performed, Williams&#39; water ballet and &quot;Oh By Jingo&quot; performed with terrific gusto by Reynolds and Van.However, there is no chemistry between Williams and Barry Sullivan. Sullivan further has the indignity of having next to nothing to do and coming over as bland. Joan Evans struggle with the singing and dancing, the inexperience really shows, and also struggles to bring any likable qualities to a character that can border on the desperately annoying.Despite some nice light, funny and endearingly fluffy moments, too much of the script is soggier than very watery cucumber sandwiches. The story is wafer thin, flimsy doesn&#39;t cut it describing the thinness of it, with pacing that really plods in the non-song and dance sequences (where the film comes to life) and an improbable resolution. &#39;Skirts Ahoy!&#39; further suffers from being overlong, due to too much of its basic narrative content being as thin as it was that was difficult to overlook, and for being over-stuffed in other parts. Direction is indifferent.Overall, not a bad film but never fully leaves the deck. Most of the cast and some nice moments keep it afloat but the story and script threaten to sink it and almost do. 5/10 Bethany Cox Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Episode #1.373 Genres: [\"Talk-Show\"] Release Date: May 4, 2020 (Japan) IMDb Rating: Unknown/10 from Unknown users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: Unknown total, Average Rating: Unknown Featured Review: Unknown Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Kr?Â\\xadsa bol??

Box Office Budget: Unknown ---  Title: Priceless Genres: [\"Comedy\",\"Romance\"] Release Date: 4/11/2008 (United States) IMDb Rating: 7.0/10 from 33069.0 users Awards: 1 wins && 1 nominations Critics Reviews: 79.0 Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: 67.0 total, Average Rating: 8.0 Featured Review: Audrey Tatou is stunning, giving a complex performance as the sexy, conniving, vulnerable and ready to love Ir??ne. The character is a gold-digger reminiscent of that other Audrey, Hepburn, in Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s, and Priceless manages to achieve the same tension of elegance and decadence, playful banter and fraught undertones. There is something very dark about the scene where Ir??ne, dumped by her latest rich beau, and left literally with only the bikini she has on, sits shivering at poolside while the sun sets and the place chances from bathers to dinner jackets. In an instant she goes from queen of her arena to a spectator. It is a complex tone shift few Hollywood (or British) rom-coms manage to attempt, never mind pull off.Gad Elmaleh as Jean is perfectly love-struck and versatile. Strong support comes from Marie-Christine Adam as the hard but equally self-deluding Madeleine, and Vernon Dobtcheff as Ir??ne&#39;s first victim, Jacques. There is something quite grown-up and yet naively innocent about this film, with characters who can do the most awful things but never enough to stop you caring about them. Vivid colour palette, and slickly shot, the music works well, too. Well worth seeing.

Release Date: 1/14/2017 (United States) IMDb Rating: 3.6/10 from 107.0 users Awards: Unknown Critics Reviews: Unknown Episode Count: Unknown User Reviews: 7.0 total, Average Rating: 2.0 Featured Review: For a low budget horror film this isn&#39;t really bad at all. it&#39;s great at creating atmosphere and some good scares along the way. The premise of a haunted livestream is kind of interesting but sort of skipped over in the film, and only marginally touched upon here and there.The film is about an hour long with the majority of that set in a single house, but the film does have random cut aways to other locations, which are used to pad out the backstory and add in some scares. The issue with this though is that the film can be a bit disorientating and it can be hard to keep up with what actually is going on and why.The film is clearly inspired by Hideo Kojima&#39;s and Konami&#39;s P.T. video game, with a similar plot, use of radio, setting and some visuals. The film is also filmed in such a way to give it the appearance of a video game, including some moments which are filmed in first person. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the video game was a critical success and sadly was cancelled before it&#39;s release so there is plenty of room to develop that lore further.Overall the film was well put together and had the occasional impressive moment, but ultimately was a bit lackluster and didn&#39;t make much sense hence the low score.

Because this is an intense, emotional journey of several characters each trying to find a reality, a world, that is livable. Set in and around wartime Sarajevo, the large cast of characters interweave in creative ways to make a powerful if clich??d story that has significance for how we see ourselves in the worst of crises.It isn&#39;t always an easy ride. The direction, by the Italian actor Sergio Castellito, is pushy, as if he knew the story was big and he made it bigger. Actors overplay some of their moments, editing is forced to pump up the adrenaline. And the plot is pushed to an extreme as wellÆ\\x92??love, , conception, war, rape, mistaken fatherhood, duplicity, and rebellion. It&#39;s all here, and if it&#39;s what makes this movie worth watching, the screenwriter, Castellito again, is trying too hard.Luckily the momentum of the events is compelling. And the setting, in the mountain laced capital of Bosnia and the dramatic coast, is interesting at every turn. The acting, too, is engaging even if overwrought. The leading man at first is an American who is a kind of idealist and optimist (and who is derisively called Jesus Christ at one point, which is about right, as his last scene will confirm). Played by Emile Hirsch with unbridled enthusiasm, we have to believe him. There is no other side to his character, and the endless earnest cheer is necessary in the rough surroundings.More dour is the woman, an expatriate Italian played by Penelope Cruz. That they hit it off is not unlikely, and the odd, intense nature of their relationship makes up the first half of the movie. We see the bohemian artist set of the city, we pay a visit to her father in Rome, they consider children in different ways. The strain grows, but the relationship doesn&#39;t crack.Until a combination of infertility and war intercede at the same time. Here the plot approaches the incredible, even though the ravages of war, and the famous rapes of that particular war (this is the 1990s), are well known. The human spirit persists in differing ways in the cast, which grows slightly, and the plot becomes both more fragmented and more fascinating. It all crashes and burns and yet there is beauty and resolution, too, by the end, and something satisfying in all the sacrifice and compromise.It&#39;s not helpful, I&#39;m sure, to say this is the kind of material that might have made a classic masterpiece of a movie, but that&#39;s what sustains this one Æ\\x92??the best of it is really terrific. It&#39;s hobbled mostly by the inexperience (or just the artistic limitations) of Castellito, who had such a huge role in the feel and scope of things the great cast wasn&#39;t enough to compensate. And to note, the novel this was based on was written by the director&#39;s wife, the son in the movie is played by his son (from what I can tell), and the director himself plays one of the secondary characters. Quite the family affair.See it? Yes, if this sounds at all compelling. It&#39;s in some large category of romanticized love-war epic with &quot;The English Patient&quot; or &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; or the troubled &quot;Atonement,&quot; but at a very different level of success.

Since everybody knows about the usual suspects, say John Waters or David Lynch, or top-ranked pornographers like Joe Sarno or Joe D&#39;Amato, a generation of young-ish fans has to search for more outr?? figures. From South America we have Marins and from Italy comes Cavallone, an unsuccessful director whose crudely made films are guaranteed never to become household names.Known for the grotesque gore and sex content of his later films (just what today&#39;s buffs thrive on), I find it instructive to examine his earlier work before he discovered how to gross out the viewer.With QUICKLY we find Cavallone, lacking budget or talent, trying to create a cute comic-strip styled action film. Elements as hoary as the mid-&#39;60s hit TV series &quot;Batman&quot; are inspiration, but he fails to create the desired romp of a MODESTY BLAISE, CANDY, DANGER DIABOLIK, DEATH LAID AN EGG, or DEADLY SWEET.Resulting film is all over the place, only moderately diverting thanks to its overacting cast. It begins with one of many typically (for Cavallone) anti-American references as bikers rob a bank in Kansas City, jokingly staged on a cheapo Western Movie town set. Then lovely Magda Konopka and motley pals steal some diamonds from a courier (the old hand-cuffed to a briefcase bit), and smuggle them in Marlboro cigarette packs.Punctuated by stock footage, especially of plane takeoffs for transitions, film picks up some steam with a ludicrous parody of Cuban-style plane hijackers, leading to our heroes &amp; heroines as prisoners in some banana republic in the midst of a revolution. Cavallone&#39;s action scenes are staged on the level of a Benny Hill skit, with apologies to the talented directors of Hill&#39;s beloved TV shows.Amidst the revolutionaries, guest star Beryl Cunningham has her mighty nipples put into action through a diaphanous gown, to briefly wake up the viewer, just as she was used memorably in BLACK DECAMERON a year later. Magda gets rescued and we almost get to see her topless.Cartoonish effects abound but are executed on the level of a nine-year-old making a short film (or today a video, I guess). Balloons for dialog are inserted as in a comic strip, and the credits are crudely etched directly on film, to show Cavallone&#39;s allegiance to experimental/underground cinema. The silliest example of this nonsense is when a hand-scratched character pops up out of a guy&#39;s coat pocket to speak to us.The women are quite attractive, notably Cavallone regular Jane Avril, though they&#39;re given almost as much unappealing eye makeup as favored by current starlet Eva Green. Male cast is a pack of hams, including one of the heroes who looks like Joe Bologna in the &#39;80s wearing his worst puddin&#39; bowl hairpiece.

I had rather high hopes for it but it just lacked a killer blow. Maybe they&#39;re saving something bigger for a sequel. The biggest moments they saved as a sizzle reel during the credits? I guess they ran out of budget or something. The horror elements were cool, the kid was actually pretty decent. Just wanted more.

Unknown User Reviews: 129.0 total, Average Rating: 7.0 Featured Review: Even though it is one of the weakest works of Hitchcock, the film surprisingly provides rich cinematic flourishes. For a 1939 film, it captures on screen the atmosphere and dark mood of the novel quite vividly??the stormy scene, the cave, and the inn (with the name board flapping in the wind). It is another matter that the albino parson of the book is transformed into a squire (with an unbelievable eyebrow make-up) in the film who commands his steed to be brought inside his dining hall. Daphne du Maurier&#39;s novel was adapted for cinema by the trio of Sidney Gilliat, Joan Harrison and J.B. Priestley, and reportedly the author did not approve of the end-product.As in many Hitchcock films there is a recurring reference to marriage. Here a good woman remains faithful to her boorish and cruel husband through thick and thin.As in most Hitchcock films there is a lot of sexual innuendo without any sex on screen, especially when Pengallen (Charles Laughton) makes the young girl (Maureen O&#39;Hara) his prisoner. (The only film where Hitchcock showed sex on screen was &quot;Frenzy.&quot;) And as in many a Hitchcock film, a bad guy turns out to be a good guy. This is one of the rare films of Hitchcock where the director does not make a cameo appearance.The best cinematic flourishes were??-the focus on the thin hands of the 17 year old who cannot be shackled by the soldiers as the handcuffs are too big, the opening &quot;prayer&quot; that serves as a grim introduction and finally the last scene of the film: Chadwick, the squire&#39;s butler, who thinks he can hear his dead master calling him for help in death.

It&#39;s been revived for undiscriminating fans on Vol. 148 of Something Weird&#39;s Dragon Art Theatre series.I&#39;ve given up pondering how Margold managed to fashion a 30 years-plus career in porn, bringing nothing to the table. He&#39;s not handsome, has no discernible talent of any kind, and like his frequent co-conspirator John Holmes, is incapable of achieving an erection. I suppose getting into the biz on the ground floor, before any standards had been established, was his trick, and crony-ism did the rest.He unwisely cast himself in the leading role, stumbling in his poor delivery of his own dialog (including longueurs when he can&#39;t think of anything to say to the girls in even the simplest of exposition scenes). He&#39;s Col. Carnal, owner of a delivery service, employing 3 young beauties. Opening credits list their modes of transportation, plugging Schwinn, Vespa and &quot;Volkswagon&quot; (sic), last one misspelled. If this was product placement, someone at each of the firms should have been fired.Inane script structure has the 3 gals visiting 3 clients, servicing them sexually, and returning to be reprimanded by Margold for humping on the job. Then he sends them back with a second delivery to exactly the same 3 customers, an obvious ploy to save money in casting more XXX talent.Margold&#39;s sloppiness and incompetence is demonstrated after he voices over their character names at the outset: Thomasina, Diedre and Harriet. Giving her an assignment, he calls Thomasina &quot;Connie&quot; by mistake, and in fact &quot;Harriet&quot; turns out to be Hari for the duration. The only amusing moment for me over the course of an hour of footage was Margold &quot;inventing&quot; the Post-it (not on the market till a year later): carefully putting scotch tape on little notes describing deliveries, and sticking them up on a calendar board on his wall.1-shot tall &amp; busty actress &quot;Dusty Darling&quot; as Thomasina drives her VW van to give chemicals to a &quot;scientist&quot; (he has a typewriter as his equipment! -talk about low-budget props). She gives him a blow job and almost immediately he ejaculates on her face, aided by a hand job, too.The wonderful, all-natural porn star Maria Tortuga (early in her career) is Hari, hopping on her bicycle (which she rides awkwardly) to deliver paper to Sylvia (blonde porn star Pat Manning), who seduces her for some lesbo action.Another 1-shot Janet Sands gets an &quot;introducing&quot; credit as Diedre, riding her Vespa scooter to hand a script to movie star Sterling Silver (porn vet R.J. Reynolds). Sands deserved another shot at stardom under the tutelage of a real director: she&#39;s a cutie with beautiful breasts.When they return, Margold takes out his wrath on Diedre, tying her up spread-eagled on his bed and forcing her to have sex. He cums on her face, though his dick remains flaccid throughout the scene.The gals&#39; return trip to their clients is more of the same, though Tortuga has a three-some when a doorman joins her and Manning, while Diedre is quite condescending to Reynolds. She takes a couple of tentative sucks at his cock, and eats a banana instead, huffily throwing the peel on his crotch and leaving. This pointless scene is typical Margold-filler: not amusing and making sense to him alone.More to the point is the trio&#39;s torturing Margold for the finale. They tie him up to his bed, whip him and humiliate him by stuffing one of their red shorts (actually panties) as uniform in his mouth, and then tying a bow with another around his limp cock. Margold clearly gets off on this sort of nonsense, but it is just another audience insult in my book.Film is poorly photographed and the sex scenes bear zero arousal value, other than a chance to see three attractive ladies. Musical score is terrible, mostly muzak plus a few recognizable tunes like a syrupy version of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, Scott Joplin&#39;s ragtime &quot;The Entertainer&quot; popularized in THE STING, and an idiotic lullaby version of the Nazi-era hit &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;.

Since I like both &quot;Beth&quot; and &quot;Shout It Out Loud&quot;, I&#39;m really looking forward to checking out his other work. &quot;Driftwood&quot; resonated strongly with its message on peoples&#39; reactions to &quot;Columbine&quot; --and it&#39;s a fantastic movie. I think that there really has not been a strong response from our communities on what the post-Columbine panic meant for people who were growing up without &quot;mainstream&quot; interests. I am greatly interested in other works by Tim Sullivan after watching this film.

I posted a photo of this film&#39;s poster and wrote that this film is pure classic, one of the best performances by the legend Shashi Kapoor.That&#39;s right, it is a classic film. It was also remade as Raja Hindustani. But for me, this film gave more of a DDLJ type vibe.Songs are great, kashmir looks so beautiful, Shashi ji&#39;s innocent and joyful character is a treat and his looks are as always great.Talking about Kashmir, there are some other classic films of the 60s that were made in beautiful kashmir such as Kashmir Ki Kali, Aarzoo.
