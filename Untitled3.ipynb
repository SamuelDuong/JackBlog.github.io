The function takes input_song_name as the input, representing the name of the song for which recommendations are to be generated. The function first calls the content_based_recommendations function to get content-based recommendations for the input song. The num_recommendations parameter determines the number of content-based recommendations to be retrieved.\n",

It also calculates the weighted popularity score using the calculate_weighted_popularity function (previously defined) based on the release date of the input song. The alpha parameter controls the relative importance of content-based and popularity-based recommendations.\n",

        "The content-based recommendations obtained earlier are stored in the content_based_rec DataFrame. The function combines the content-based recommendations with the input song’s information (track name, artists, album name, release date, and popularity) and its weighted popularity score. This step creates a DataFrame named hybrid_recommendations that includes both the content-based recommendations and the input song’s data.\n",

This step ensures that the most popular and relevant songs appear at the top of the recommendations.
