# Project Overview

This repository hosts two innovative projects aimed at advancing data exploration and analysis in distinct domains using cutting-edge technologies.

## 1. Implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with OpenAI's API for IMDB Review

This project focuses on leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation model combined with Langchain and OpenAI's API to create a sophisticated data retrieval system. Specifically designed for the IMDB media dataset, it allows users to efficiently retrieve and summarize a broad spectrum of media-related information. This component empowers seamless exploration and analysis of media content, enhancing understanding and insights.

## 2. Question Answering Using Embeddings for Sports Analytics

The second project component develops a Question and Answer (Q&A) system using ChatGPT and specialized embeddings tailored for sports analytics. This innovative system enables analysts and sports enthusiasts to interactively query sports-related datasets, obtaining deeper insights into performance metrics, strategies, and trends across various sports.

# Installation and Setup

To get started with these projects, clone this repository to your local machine. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, along with Jupyter Notebooks to run and interact with the provided notebooks.


# Usage

To use the RAG system or the Q&A system:

1. Navigate to the respective notebook directory.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Lab or Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions within each notebook to run the systems.
