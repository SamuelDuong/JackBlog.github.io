# Project Overview

This repository hosts two innovative projects aimed at advancing data exploration and analysis in distinct domains using cutting-edge technologies.

## 1. Implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System with OpenAI's API for IMDB Review

This project focuses on leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation model combined with Langchain and OpenAI's API to create a sophisticated data retrieval system. Specifically designed for the IMDB media dataset, it allows users to efficiently retrieve and summarize a broad spectrum of media-related information. This component empowers seamless exploration and analysis of media content, enhancing understanding and insights.

## 2. Question Answering Using Embeddings for Sports Analytics

Our project revolutionizes sports analytics by developing a sophisticated Q&A system powered by ChatGPT and embeddings. This system is specifically tailored for sports analysts and enthusiasts, providing a seamless platform to query sports-related datasets, with a special emphasis on retrieving information from the 2022 World Cup data. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, it enables users to ask complex questions in plain language and receive meaningful answers, democratizing access to sports analytics and fostering data-driven decision-making in the sports industry.
